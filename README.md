# GUI_thin_films
This project is intended to help the characterization of thin films, via an interface with ease of use, and background algorithms to accelerate data analysis.
It has three main milestones, that could/should be achievable with enough time:
1) Configuration of AEL characterization
   a) Write a Help me File/Manual
3) Configuration of RBS characterization
4) Configuration of AlfaMC simulator on par with the results of the interface, for AEL characterization

For the interface to run, it is required to install the Python Tkinter and Matplotlib Libraries.

Main issues:
  Making the Plots that show up interactive. (Fixed)
  Making sure the Tabs open up new menus (Fixed)
  Making sure the Frames are stationary (Fixed)
  Making sure the Interface opens up to the user's computer (Fixed)
