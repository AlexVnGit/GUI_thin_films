# GUI_thin_films
This project is intended to help the characterization of thin films, via an interface with ease of use, and background algorithms to accelerate data analysis. It is the result of a summer internship at LIP, and is intended
for use of the NUC-RIA group. ARC-TF stands for Alpha energy loss and Rutherford back-scattering methods for 
Characterization of Thin Films.

As of now, the GUI can characterize the thickness of thin films using the Alpha Energy Loss. There is no version
that can calculate the thickness by the Rutherford back-scattering method. As of now, ARC-TF only works for 
Windows.

This GUI was created by Alexandre Gusm√£o.
