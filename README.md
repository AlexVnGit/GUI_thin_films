# ARC-TF
ARC-TF stands for Alpha particles' energy loss and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry methods for Characterization of Thin Films.

ARC-TF is a GUI (Guided User Interface) intended to expedite the process of characterizing thin films, via an interface with ease of use, and backend algorithms that accelerate the data analysis.

This project  is the result of a LIP Summer Internship, within the NUC-RIA group. A publication resulting from the internship, resuming the work taken to develop the first version of ARC-TF, can be searched for by the reference LIP-STUDENTS-23-15. Directly available at https://www.lip.pt/files/training/papers/2023/pdf/2023-PAPER-179-15.pdf

As of now, the ARC-TF can characterize the thickness of thin films measured using the Alpha Energy Loss method. There is no version that can calculate the thickness by the Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry method, yet. 

For the time being, ARC-TF only works for Windows.

ARC-TF was created by Alexandre Gusm√£o (https://github.com/AlexVnGit) and modified by Ricardo Matoza Pires (https://github.com/RiPires).
